const faqs: FAQ[] = [
  {
    question: "How often should I use the products?",
    answer: "For best results, use Haven Bliss and Haven Glow daily. Haven Muse should be used 2-3 times per week, depending on your skin's needs."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use the products on sensitive skin?",
    answer: "Yes, all Haven products are formulated with gentle, natural ingredients suitable for sensitive skin. However, we recommend doing a patch test before first use."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the best time to apply the products?",
    answer: "The best time is right after bathing when your skin is still slightly damp, as this helps lock in maximum moisture. However, you can apply the products whenever your skin needs nourishment."
  },
  {
    question: "How long will the products last?",
    answer: "With regular use as directed, each product should last approximately 2-3 months. The Body Oil may last longer as you need less product per application."

    question: "Do you offer international shipping?",
